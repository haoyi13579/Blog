# How to Change Language in Furhat

Need different context file (Grammar file, xml format).

There are examples on Furhat Bitbucket. Considering its not my code, I don't know if I can copy it. Just record some tips.

1. The synthesizer name is just the name. E.g. HuiHui or David, not Windows-HuiHui-zh-cn or some other things.

2. To change the recognizer language, it needs not only modifications in skills and flow (different context setting), also needs to change the head 
part, change the language in the head part.
